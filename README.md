# The time it took you to perform the excercise
The project from start to finish took just under 5 hours.

# The parts that were difficult for you and why
The aspect that took the longest was creating the mesh for the track from the bezier curve I generated. I hadn't had much experience with bezier curves before, and it was a new challenge for me!

# The parts that you think you could do better and how
I was hoping I could be able to make the path that you follow a raised 3D mesh, rather than a 2D plane, but I concerned about time constraints.

# What would you do if you could go a step further on this game
Alongside adding in the 3D mesh, I would love to create new maps with randomly generated curves. I have made random curves before in another project and they look great! Also, adding some variety to the obstacles would be fun.

# What did you think
I'm happy with how the project turned out, the 5 hours flew by much faster than I was expecting, and I was hoping I could add more into it. But overall, I'm really happy with the end result! 

# Any comment you may have
Unless it wasn't clear, to move you simply touch the screen! If you have any feedback, or things I could add, I'd love to hear it!

The vast majority of the code for the Bezier curves and the mesh generation was taken from this tutorial:

I have previously worked with bezier curves when generating random tracks for a racing game I'm working on, but that used a LineRenderer to display it. I chose to go with mesh generation instead as I was thinking it would allow me to edit the mesh later down the line to be raised, instead of a flat plane. Time didn't allow me to do this in the end, but that would've been my next step.
